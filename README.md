## The Business Problem
Acme Co. wanted to understand why some regions and products consistently outperformed others, whether their revenue was sustainable, and how pricing, channels, and customer behavior influenced profitability.

However, their sales data was fragmented across multiple dimensions — products, customers, channels, and regions — making it difficult to extract clear insights.

### Goal
Transform raw sales data (2021–2025) into actionable insights that help leadership optimize growth, reduce risk, and improve profitability.


## My Approach as a Data Analyst
I approached this project like a real-world business case:

### 1. Data Understanding & Preparation
- Cleaned and structured transactional sales data.
- Created derived metrics: profit, margin, monthly trends, and performance indicators.
- Built analytical datasets for time series, product, channel, and customer analysis.
- Connected all the sheets to each other.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified patterns, trends, and anomalies using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib).
- Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
- Validated business assumptions using correlation and distribution analysis.

### 3. Business Intelligence (Power BI)
- Designed interactive dashboards to communicate insights.
- Built KPIs and drill-down views for stakeholders.
- Enabled dynamic filtering by region, product, channel, and time.

## What the Data Revealed

### Revenue & Seasonality
- Monthly revenue remained stable between $23M–$26.5M, indicating a strong and predictable business model.
- Sales peaked during May–June and dipped in January, revealing clear seasonal behavior.
- A sharp drop in early 2024 emerged as an anomaly, highlighting potential operational or market disruptions.
#### Insight:
The business is stable but vulnerable to unexpected shocks — proactive monitoring is essential.
