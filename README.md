## The Business Problem
Acme Co. wanted to understand why some regions and products consistently outperformed others, whether their revenue was sustainable, and how pricing, channels, and customer behavior influenced profitability.

However, their sales data was fragmented across multiple dimensions — products, customers, channels, and regions — making it difficult to extract clear insights.
